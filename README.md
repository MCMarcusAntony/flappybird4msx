This is a *demake* of .GEARS Studio's [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird) and my first and public program entirely coded in Z80 assembly. Works on any MSX model with automatic screen refresh detection (50Hz or 60Hz) to adjust the game speed. And if you're using a MSX turbo R it will use the R800 mode.

In my [blog](https://giovannireisnunes.wordpress.com/meu-software/flappy-bird-para-msx/) you will find more information about the game and the binaries to download.
